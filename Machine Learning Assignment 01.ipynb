Among the algorithms used is the ability to discover similarities and differences in the customers preferences and purchasing patterns. This in turn is used to expedite and simplify segmentation, thus enabling the retail entity to enhance its targeting. This is done by using machine learning powered technologies that captures, analyse and use the data to personalize the shopping experience in real time.  With the exponential growth of e-commerce’s, this technology has also been embraced and used by online retailers. Among the players that uses machine learning technologies are players such as Amazon, Lazada , Walmart and Tesco."
